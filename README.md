# Precision Notes

Hi and Welcome to our Project "Precision-Notes"!

Created by: Amy, Cole, Konnor, Kendrick and Thomas

Goal: 
The goal of this application is to create a interactive applicative with note-taking properties. The application consists of a general homepage, with several subfunctions (Calculator, Flashcards, etc.)
