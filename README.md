# Precision Notes

Hi and Welcome to our Project "Precision-Notes"!
Created by: Amy, Cole, Konnor, Kendrick and Thomas


Goal: 
The goal of this application is to create a interactive applicative with note-taking properties. The application consists of a general homepage, with several subfunctions (Calculator, Flashcards, etc.)
We hope and wish that this application will be used by students to improve their academic standings and change study habits.


Designs and Documentation:
Documentation can be found within the "Design and Documentation" directory. This directory contains a UI blueprint and a design report amoong other things.


Flashcards Functionality:
  Android Studio Files (Ease of Access):

  Precision-Notes\src (Flashcard)\Code Features (Flashcards)\app\src\main\java\MainActivity.kt" (This is main_activity for the Flashcard functionality. This contains the coded functions that allow for the flashcard mechanisms.)
  Precision-Notes\src (Flashcard)\Code Features (Flashcards)\app\src\main\res\layout"  (This contains the layout/GUI for the flashcard functionality.)


FormulaLib:
  Contains a list of calulcator functions and calculations to allow for faster computations for users. (This will work in conjuction with the calculation application.)

Important Notes:

For accessing the repo, follow these steps:

1) Download gitbash (it's free)
2) Create an empty folder and access it with either the gitbash terminal or right-clicking the folder and opening gitbash here. 
3) Git clone (repo link), into new folder with the use of gitbash.
4) You can move whatever folders/files into here (please make it organized.)
5) Then you can use android studio to create new branches, all of these functions should be under the git tab.
